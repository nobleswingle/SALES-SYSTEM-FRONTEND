## Overview

The Sales Management System is an **offline-first retail** management platform designed for provision stores, supermarkets, and small-to-large retail shops.

It replaces manual record-keeping methods such as notebooks, Excel sheets, and loosely structured POS usage with a structured, reliable system that runs on a store’s PC and connects to mobile devices over a local network.

> ⚠️ Note: This system does not replace POS hardware entirely.
Instead, it acts as a centralized management system that improves how sales, inventory, and reporting are handled within a store.

The system is designed for environments with poor or unstable internet connectivity, prioritizing local reliability over cloud dependency.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

One PC inside the store acts as the local server (host machine).

- The PC runs the backend and database
- Mobile devices connect via local WiFi network
- The system operates fully offline in Phase 1

This creates a private in-store network system, where all operations happen locally without internet dependence.

---

## 💡 Why Offline First?

- Many target stores operate in low or unstable network conditions
- Sales operations must never stop due to internet failure
- Local systems provide faster response times
- Internet-based features will be added later, not required for core functionality

---

## 👥 User Roles

### Admin (Store Owner)

- Full control over the system
- Manages products, pricing, employees, and reports
- Access to audit logs and system analytics

### Manager

- Oversees sales and inventory
- Reviews reports and employee performance
- Operates under admin-defined permissions

### Employee

- Records sales transactions
- Limited to operational tasks
- Cannot modify system configurations

> Note: Roles are independent of device.
Any authorized user can access the system from either PC or mobile depending on permissions.

---

## 🧱 System Architecture

### Local Server Model

- Backend runs on a store PC using Python
- Database is stored locally (SQLite or similar)
- Devices connect via local WiFi network

### How It Works

1. The PC starts the server
2. Other devices connect using the PC’s IP address
3. All requests are processed locally
4. Data is stored instantly in the local database

Think of it as a mini internal network system inside the shop.

---

## 🗄️ Database Strategy (Phase 1)

- Single store per installation
- All data stored locally on the PC
- No multi-store support in this phase

## Future Upgrade

- Multi-tenant system
- Cloud synchronization
- Remote access

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

- Login required for all users
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Activity logging for accountability
- Admin-controlled permissions

### Security Focus

- Prevent unauthorized changes
- Maintain data integrity
- Track all user actions transparently

---

## 🖥️ CLI Developer Tools

Developer-only tools for system control:

- "setup" → Initialize system
- "reset-db" → Reset database
- "seed-demo" → Populate demo data

These tools are restricted to developers only.

---

## 📲 Installation (CLI-Based)

1. Clone repository

```
git clone <repo-url>
cd sales-management-system
```

2. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Setup system

```
python cli.py setup
```

4. Start server

```
python main.py
```

---

## 📡 Local Network Setup

1. Connect PC and mobile devices to the same WiFi network
2. Get PC IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.10)
3. Open on mobile browser:

```
http://192.168.1.10:PORT
```

## 🧭 Closing Vision

This system begins as a local store management tool and evolves into a full retail platform.

The priority is not complexity.

It is reliability inside real stores with real users.
